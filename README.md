# Signature-Verification
Repository for [AXIS Bank AI Hackathon](https://www.hackerearth.com/sprints/axis-hackathon/?utm_source=challenges-modern&utm_campaign=registered-challenges&utm_medium=right-panel) on [Hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com). 

In this project, I have used 28x28 pixel images for training. As far I have made a small Siamese Network which is working pretty well.

## Requirements: 
1. Install Python 3.6 
2. Pip install Pytorch 0.4.0 

Data is already in the "data" folder. Open jupyter Notebook and Run the "Signature_Axis_hackathon.ipynb" file.
